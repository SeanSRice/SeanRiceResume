Sean Rice Assignment-10 Readme


13: A system font is a font that is already installed on your system right out of
    the box. System fonts will be available to all the programs you use, but not
    necessarily available on the web / web safe, as not all systems come with the
    same fonts installed. They are also exported as images, which affects search
    engine indexing and assistive technologies.
    Web fonts are fonts that are hosted on a server and do not need to be installed
    on the user's system to render properly. Most websites use web fonts, but they
    are not fool proof as browser compatibility with older machines is not guaranteed.
    Web safe fonts are fonts that are guaranteed to be on the user's system, and
    thus will have no problem rendering. Arial and Times New Roman are examples,
    since whether you use Windows, Linux or Mac, those fonts will be on the system
    and able to be accessed by the browser without issue.

14: It is important to have fallback fonts or a font stack because not all fonts,
    especially web fonts, are available on all browsers or systems. With fallback
    fonts, you can maintain some semblance of the intended look and feel of your
    website, even if someone's browser is not compatible with the ideal font.

15: Wouldn't you know it? Just like every week, I just duplicated my previous
    assignment, hollowed it out of content, and started adding any requirements
    that were not already there, such as pseudo elements, etc. As per usual, 99.9%
    of my time was spent not working on my own assignment, but dropping everything
    I was doing / typing /reading to help my girlfriend with hers, so you could even
    say I got 2x the experience in on the matter.
