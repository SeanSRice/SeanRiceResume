1. How is the web different than the internet?

The internet, which seems to be spoken of often in terms of its fiber optic cables and other physical aspect, is what connects
paricipants and systems into a sort of system of systems, an international network - internet. The web on the other hand, in contrast
to the trees originally used, is sort of a giant data strucutre that connects all the information in those systems to eachother. 
The internet connects the people / systems, and the web connects the information those people and systems have. 

2. Briefly describe how the internet works.

The internet is like a big wire that infromation can travel on. When I log onto gmail, that information, along with my internet
protocol address, is sent along the wire in packets to routers, which add some information of their own, and help my packets get on
their way. My computer is a client of an ISP, who actually does the real footwork in sending my packets across the internet, where they
are helped by more routers until they reach their destination. When a response is sent, is includes all the information that the original
routers added, and this information is used to help backtrack the pack of the info back to my own computer. 

3. What is a directory, and what is its relationship to files?

Directory is synonymous folder, like what we see on our desktop. They function in the same way, by containing sets of related files. 
Since directories / folders are also files, a directory can contain other directories, but the relation to files is that directoires
contain them and help keep them organized. 

4. Why is using a VCS beneficial?

Using a VCS, or version control system, is benneficial because we can: 
-Track changes: keep track of the changes the team has made, who's done what, the rate of progress, bugs, etc.
-Revert back: When someone (or you) screws something up and breaks the code, the project can easily be reverted back to a previous
  state when everything worked instead of having to find the bug or make a patchwork of bandaid code
-Share and collaborate: multiple people can easily work on the same project at the same time in different places, and then 
  consolidate their changes, or go on to create entirely different projects.
