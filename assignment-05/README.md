Sean Rice: Assignment-05

13: An html page can only have one head, and one body. The head contains the "thoughts"
    of the webpage, or things visitors cannot see, such as metadata about the page.
    However, this information will be visible to browsers and search engines for
    various reasons. Meanwhile the body of the page contains the "meat and potatoes",
    AKA the main elements of the page that the visitor will be viewing / interacting
    with, such as paragraphs, headings, lists, etc..

14: Structural markup embeds information about the structure of the page, such
    as what is a heading, what is a paragraph, what is a list and what are its
    elements, where there should be break points, etc. Meanwhile, semantic markup
    is used to enforce the semantics, or meaning of the content of the page. As we
    all know, bolding or italicizing a word or phrase changes its meaning, and semantic
    markup allows us to apply these kinds of changes to the content of the page
    to maintain that meaning.

15: My work cycle for this assignment (bearing in mind that I don't actually known
    the definition of 'work cycle') started as is generally starts - copying and
    pasting in the content of my previous index.html. I find this is the easiest
    way to make sure I start off with the four core elements and proper indentation,
    etc. Then, I made my way down the assignment requirements list, adding some things
    by memory, like headings and lists, but referencing back to the notes for other
    things like some semantic markup options, which I then applied (to the recipe
    that I completely copied and pasted from some website). I continued this pattern
    until the end, finishing with copying and pasting the university address directly
    from your website. Then I opened it up in my browser to check that it looked good,
    fixed my comment because it was appearing, checked my link, and then started on the
    questions, and finally here we are.
