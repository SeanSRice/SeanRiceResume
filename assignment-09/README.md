13: The universal selector is the '*', as in everything, as in "drop table *"
    when you want to ruin someones. Life. "*"Apparently is also has some effect
    on markdown that I was not aware of. Anyway, the star operator selects everything
    in the document to apply style rules to, every single element.
    The element selector specifies a certain type of element, such as h1 or div,
    that the style rule will affect. The rule will affect all elements of that type.
    The class element is defined by the programmer as .classNameHere, and all elements
    that have that classname will be affected - regardless of their type. You could
    use a class to make some, but not all h1's blue, and use the same class to make
    h2's blue as well. An id is similar to a class, the name is defined with a #
    before it instead of a period. The id is considered more specific so it will
    have precedence over the class style.

14. The colors I chose were gold, dark blue, and silver. I found a few sources that
    regarded these colors as being related to art deco and 1920s art, so I went
    with them. The rgb values for the blue and gold were pulled directly from the
    background image I found, and the silver is just the default "silver" in css.
    Gold: rgb(238, 210, 137)
    Blue: rgb(55, 64, 97)
    Silver: (Just type silver 'color: silver;' into the css)

15: You're not gonna believe this, but my work cycle for this assignement was exactly
    the same as for every other assignement. My work cycle was the same as always.
    I read through the entirety of the lesson
    on your website. Then, I begin the assignment by copying and pasting my previous
    assignment, and "gutting it" of everything not needed for this one. I make my
    way down the requirements, copying and pasting from previous assignments, your
    code, and writing some stuff from memory as I go. Occasionally, every 3 or 4
    requirements, I stop and open it in the browser to make sure the code is working.
    I realized half way through that I kind of picked a long topic and it was taking
    a while to get down but hey, it is what it is! I even reused the css from the
    last assignment, just changed the colors and put it in a different file. The
    hardest part was finding nice pictures that I liked (and helping my girlfriend)
    work through the assignemnt too).
