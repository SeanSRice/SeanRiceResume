Sean Rice Assignment-09 Readme

13: My imaginary client was you - their needs were the requirements of the assignment.
    I also embellished their needs by selecting a logo and deciding that the site
    color scheme and fonts had to match that of the logo, and that was essentially
    it. They also wanted my website not to just be recoloration of my last assignment,
    just to keep things interesting. So I guess my client was you and Northstar Coffee.

14: Display block makes it a block element for vertical display, inline makes it
    take up only as much space as needed, and inline block makes it begin utilizing
    things like margin and still be inline.


15: You're not gonna believe this, but my work cycle for this assignment was exactly
    the same as for every other assignment. My work cycle was the same as always.
    I read through the entirety of the lesson
    on your website. Then, I begin the assignment by copying and pasting my previous
    assignment, and "gutting it" of everything not needed for this one. I make my
    way down the requirements, copying and pasting from previous assignments, your
    code, and writing some stuff from memory as I go. Occasionally, every 3 or 4
    requirements, I stop and open it in the browser to make sure the code is working.
    The most difficult part was my refusal to just use random images so I had to spend
    time finding real ones that went with the site even though you didn't want me
    to.
