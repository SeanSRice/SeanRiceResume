    the border can be used to outline the shape of the element, and the margin
    is the space between one element and the next.

15: You're not gonna believe this, but my work cycle for this assignement was exactly
    the same as for every other assignement. My work cycle was the same as always.
    I read through the entirety of the lesson
    on your website. Then, I begin the assignment by copying and pasting my previous
    assignment, and "gutting it" of everything not needed for this one. I make my
    way down the requirements, copying and pasting from previous assignments, your
    code, and writing some stuff from memory as I go. Occasionally, every 3 or 4
    requirements, I stop and open it in the browser to make sure the code is working.
    The most difficult part was creating a layout for a website (and I guess
    implementing it too) because I am not a very artistic or visually oriented
    person, and I am terrible at CSS - even with the lesson right in front of me.
