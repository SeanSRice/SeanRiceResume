13: I went to amazon.com ten years in the past, and honestly, it didn't look that
    different. It was perhaps a little less minimalist, a little more white space,
    a little less flashy color gradients on the borders. There was also a lot more
    text - nowadays it just shows you the images, not names or prices until
    you go ahead and click on something you think you like. Overall, it didn't look
    unlike I might expect a modern shopping website to look for a small company or
    startup or something.

14: I have used GIT in the past so my experience was positive and I don't have
    any complaints, though my girlfriend was very confused the whole time and
    needed a lot of hand holding on top of your tutorials.
