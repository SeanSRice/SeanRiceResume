      <h1>About: Why This?</h1>
      <p>The simplest reason for why I chose this tutorial is that it was the first
        that came to my mind - and I figured it would be more time efficient to just
        go with it than to spend the time thinking of somehthing else. I was probably
        wrong about that to be honest, as it was a bit lengthy, but that's okay.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The reason it was on my mind at all is I have been thinking more about camping
        and spending time in nature lately, as I think more poeple would be happier
        if they engaged in these activities more often - myself included. I also think
        it's very cool to be able to survive without so many 'modern' tools like just
        kerosene and a ligheter, so I've been thinking about taking a wilderness survival
        class lately as well.
        <br/>

        For those interested in learning more, I have linked the video I learned this
        from below. In the video, he uses a bow to start his fire instead of hand drill,
        but I figured that is a tutorial for a different time. Otherwise, you can
        just look up "bushcraft" of "wilderness survival" on Youtube and find many
        similar videos, even for different biomes.
