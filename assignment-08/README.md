Sean Rice: Assignment 7

13:   Learning HTML was fun. I am a computer scientist and while HTML is obviously
      important for web development, most professors simply wave it off and say
      "It's easy! You can learn it on your own." The reality is, I don't think any
      of them know the half of html, and probably haven't used it (or css) since
      about 1999. I am glad to have finally learned or at least started Learning
      it in a professional capacity instead of just googling over and over how to
      style this or link to a website, etc. and just having a patchwork of awful
      code I found online. Now it's much better and I look forward to learning css
      because it's also very important and I'm awful at it. It wasn't too hard
      to learn since I have a programming background.

14:   I am mostly just anxious that even after learning about website styling,
      I will still be bad at it. I've been doing it in some capacity for quite
      a while now and am still pretty bad, despite lots of googling and copying and
      pasting. I know you're a good teacher so if we finish this section and I am
      still bad, it will just mean I do not have an eye for design.

15: My work cycle was the same as always. I read through the entirety of the lesson
    on your website. Then, I begin the assignment by copying and pasting my previous
    assignment, and "gutting it" of everything not needed for this one. I make my
    way down the requirements, copying and pasting from previous assignments, your
    code, and writing some stuff from memory as I go. Occasionally, every 3 or 4
    requirements, I stop and open it in the browser to make sure the code is working.
    I realized half way through that I kind of picked a long topic and it was taking
    a while to get down but hey, it is what it is!
