Sean Rice Assignment 06

13: In my time on the web, I have come across many various types of forms, but
    as I've gotten older, the variety has leveled off. The most common of course
    is the username / password form, used to verify my identity and log me into
    various services. Then you have cc info / shipping address info used for online
    purchases so that my bank can make appropriate payments and the warehouse can
    send my goods to the right location. There are also various "sign up" forms
    used to initially create accounts, like when you first make a gmail or something.
    Finally, there are online quizzes like I used to take when I was a kid, which
    are mostly for entertainment and to make ad revenue off of bored middle schoolers
    clicking whatever they see.


14: Text selection could be like username / password, shipping info, cc info, etc.
    Essentially anywhere number of options are potentially infinite or not known in
    advance. Selection forms are for when there is a finite number of discrete options,
    and the options are known in advance - such as state someone lives in. While
    there are a finite number of valid phone numbers, it is better not to use a
    selection since there are far too many options. About 50 is probably not a bad
    upper limit if it can be helped. As far as button input, such as submit, upload,
    subscribe, etc, they are all over the place. I think even liking a post is a form
    of button input. At the end of the day, they all have similar or the same purpose,
    collect some form of data from the user and send it to the database to be stored,
    referenced and or manipulated by the service / company in question.

15: My work cycle was the same as always. I read through the entirety of the lesson
    on your website. Then, I begin the assignment by copying and pasting my previous
    assignment, and "gutting it" of everything not needed for this one. I make my
    way down the requirements, copying and pasting from previous assignments, your
    code, and writing some stuff from memory as I go. Occasionally, every 3 or 4
    requirements, I stop and open it in the browser to make sure the code is working.
    Then, before I know it, I'm here, and it's over.
