Sean Rice: Assignment 7

13:   Divs and ids are attributes that can be given to different elements to help
      differentiate them, and add style to them. A class of style can be defined
      in the head on in a  CSS file that can then be applied to an entire div,
      table, or other element by using the attribute class="class-name-here".
      An id is used to distinguish elements from eachother based on their content,
      and if I'm not mistaken a style can also be prescribed based on an id that
      an element has.
      Meanwhile, a div or "division" of a website is a way to break the content
      of the page up into similar chunks that might be grouped together or receive
      similar styling. A span is the inline equivalent of a div, and multiple span
      elements can exist within a div element.

14:   Alt text is the alternate to an image or video. We use it so that if an image
      or video doesn't load, something can still be loaded to let the user know what
      would have /should have been there. They are also useful for accessibility
      and screen reader purposes, so that people who cannot see or hear the content
      can still know what it is.

15: My work cycle was the same as always. I read through the entirety of the lesson
    on your website. Then, I begin the assignment by copying and pasting my previous
    assignment, and "gutting it" of everything not needed for this one. I make my
    way down the requirements, copying and pasting from previous assignments, your
    code, and writing some stuff from memory as I go. Occasionally, every 3 or 4
    requirements, I stop and open it in the browser to make sure the code is working.
    I did have the issue half way through of realizing that my video was supposed
    to be the music video, and the song was supposed to be my favorite song, but
    I figured you wouldn't mind since I'm getting the same experience either way.
    I was also incredulous to find out how easy it was to embed videos, music and
    even maps!
